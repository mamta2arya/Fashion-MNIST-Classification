# Fashion-MNIST-Classification

1.	Original dataset has 60,000 28x28 pixel greyscale images of 10 different categories of clothing items as labels. Here in this project customized dataset only with 5 lables are used.
2. Performed Feature Extraction using Principal Component Analysis then build the machine learning model using algorithms such as Support Vector Machine, K-nearest Neighbor, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boost to reduce computational time. Achieved the highest accuracy of 90 % using SVM.
3. To improve the accuracy further Convolutional Neural Network is applied with max-pooling and dropout layers and achieved an accuracy of 95 %.
